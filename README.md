## Project Motivation 🚀  
This project was inspired by the increasing need for sustainable agricultural practices. Excessive pesticide use and labor shortages are significant challenges, and UAVs offer a promising solution. By building on existing research, this project demonstrates how drones can contribute to more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly farming.  
## Features ✨
* **Research-Based Design:** Combines findings from multiple studies to create a comprehensive simulation of a quadcopter for agricultural use.
* **Targeted Pesticide Spraying:** Incorporates research-backed techniques for precise pesticide application, reducing waste and environmental damage.
* **Pest Detection System:** Utilizes insights from image processing techniques to identify pest-affected areas for efficient spraying.
* **Simulink Simulation:** Validates quadcopter dynamics, control stability, and performance under simulated agricultural conditions.
* **3D Physical Modeling:** A detailed quadcopter model, inspired by industry-standard designs, is created in SolidWorks and integrated into the simulation environment.
* **Sustainability-Oriented:** Emphasizes reducing pesticide overuse and promoting environmentally friendly agricultural practices.
